Your job is to fix the code in this lab so that you can see Cheese cards with images appear the screen.

**All bugs are intentional. You should carefully read error messages from your terminal, your browser, and your linter in VSCode, to work out how to fix them all.**

You will need to refresh the page in Chrome after you fix you a bug, to check if you actually fixed it (this will usually show you more bugs that need fixing..)

Also, there are no CSS bugs in this one. We're not that mean.

Good luck!

- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to run
